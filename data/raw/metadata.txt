The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split.
Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, e.g. 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe.
The data set itself was uploaded on Kaggle:

Contents:

- car_data folder, which contains train and test folders. Each of these folders
contains folders with the cars' make, model and year of production. 
Each of these folders contains images of the particular make and model.

- names.csv contains all the 196 names of the cars in this data set

- anno_train.csv and anno_test.csv - image file, bounding boxes and class number

Instructions on how to download the data:

 - Install python and run in the terminal or a command line:
 
     pip install kaggle

 - Set up API credentials by doing the following steps:

     - Go to Kaggle and create a free account
     
     - Click the profile picture on the top right and go to Settings
     
     - Navigate down to the API menu
     
     - Click on "Create New Token"
     
     - It will download a file: kaggle.json.
     
     - Move this file to:

      - Windows: C:/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.kaggle/kaggle.json

      - Mac/Linux: ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
      
     - Run the following line to check if the installation is succesfull:
     
     kaggle --version
     
     The output should look something like - Kaggle API 1.x.x...
     
  - If the above does not work, it might be because you need to add the location of kaggle.exe to your PATH
 To do that, follow these steps:
 
  - In bash, terminal, or command line, type [where kaggle] to get its location
  
  - Press Windows + S and search: Environment Variables

  - Open: "Edit the system environment variables"

  - In the System Properties window, click the Environment Variables button

  - Under "User variables", find the one named Path, select it, then click Edit

  - Click New, and paste the path you copied

  - Click OK to close all dialogs
  
  
 - When kaggle is installed properly, all is left to do is to run the code in [src/download-data.R]
 In /data/raw, this will create a zip file containing the data, and a car-data folder containing the extracted contents of the zip file
